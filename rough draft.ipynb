Game theory is used to determine different strategy to compete with one another. Game theory is also used in everyday life to make decision like when to change lanes in traffic, when to cross the road or even when to do your assignment.\n",

The best outcome for the Dealer is going to be to get you to pay above sticker price for the car. Let’s say the salesman tries to get you to pay 40,000 for a car that cost the dealership 30,000 to get on the lot and sell. Ideally you would want to know exactly how much they paid for it so you could get it for that price. But in the real world the salesman won’t tell you how much he needs out of the car. However, you also have power in this situation because the dealer doesn’t know how much you are willing to pay for the car. Ideally you would meet exactly in the middle so each party leaves happy. That is not how buying a car works though. There is always a winner and a loser and the dealership wins the majority of the time.
